# Predix Design Stencil
This repository contains files with the most current symbols library, stencils, color swatches, and fonts for your Predix UI design project. Stencils are provided in Sketch formats.

The Predix Components Master is a Sketch document that contains Predix component symbols which you can use in any of your Sketch documents. If there are updates to the master file, documents containing instances of the master file will receive a notification to update to the lastest version. This will guarantee you will have the lastest version and any additions to the Sketch documents.
The Predix Design System starter kit is composed of symbols from the Predix Components Master file and layout examples. Please use the starter kit as a way to build stencils for your product and applications.
